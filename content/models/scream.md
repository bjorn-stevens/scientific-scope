## Model description: 
Developed under the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) project, the Simple Cloud-Resolving E3SM Atmosphere Model (SCREAM) is a non-hydrostatic, spectral element atmospheric model that discretizes the globe on a cubed sphere (Caldwell et al., 2021). Details of the code and components that comprise the model can be found in Donahue et al. (2024).
